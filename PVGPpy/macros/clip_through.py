def clip_through(clip, ax, bounds, num=10, delay=1.0):
    """
    This macro takes a clip source and progresses its location through a set of
    bounds in the data scene. The macro requires that the clip already exist in
    the pipeline. This is especcially useful if you have many clips linked
    together as all will move through the seen as a result of this macro.

    Parameters
    ----------
    clip : string
        The string name of the clip source to be translated.
    ax : int
        This is the axis on which to tranlate (0 for x, 1 for y, 2 for z).
        Think of this as the normal vector for the clip.
    bounds : 6-element list or tuple
        These are the bounds to constrain the clip translation.
    num : int, optional
        The number of discritizations in the clip translation.
    delay : float, optional
        Time delay in seconds before conducting each clip translation.
